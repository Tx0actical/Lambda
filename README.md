## LAMBDA - Malware Classification and Remediation Engine in C# using VirusTotal API and WinUI 3 Design Elements

In general, AV products feature complex architecture with many interacting components static, dynamic,
and heuristic engines, sandbox, scanner, emulator, unpacker and so on. This increases the overall size of 
the program and the attack surface.

One of the design goal of LAMBDA is simplicity. By utilising the VirusTotal API for detection, we aim to
significantly cut down on the complexity that AV products generally work with.
